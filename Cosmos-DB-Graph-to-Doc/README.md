# Cosmos DB Graph to Doc

This demo shows how to query Cosmos DB Graph using Cosmos DB DocumentDB (also called SQL) API in C#.

The demo sample is a Visual Studio 2017 solution with one project.  The entire non-boiler plate code is
contained in [Program.cs](DemoDocDbOnGraph/Program.cs).

See the [following blog post](http://vincentlauzon.com/2017/09/05/hacking-accessing-a-graph-in-cosmos-db-with-sql-documentdb-api/) for details.
